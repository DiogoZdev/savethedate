# Az - Wedding website

We were about to complete 1 year married. I decided to quickly build this project to make available some special memories to our families.

Here it is:

As there is no gallery component in angular, I did my best to make one from scratch.
If there is anything that could be improved, please, let me know.

## in this project
- Angular
- TypeScript
- Scss
